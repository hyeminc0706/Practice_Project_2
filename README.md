# 🎨 ALTools Practice Project  
### 🧩 UI/UX Design & Frontend Implementation (Personal Practice Project)

A front‑end practice project focused on exploring UI layout, animations, and interactive components.  
I designed and developed the entire interface to study how motion and component behavior influence user experience.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project was created to practice building modular UI components and applying animations to enhance interaction flow.  
The goal was to understand how layout, timing, and motion contribute to a more engaging user interface.

## 🔍 Process

### 1️⃣ Concept & Wireframing
- Planned the project concept  
- Created wireframes focused on modular UI components  
- Defined interaction flow and animation behavior  

### 2️⃣ UI Design
- Designed a clean, structured layout  
- Applied spacing and contrast for clarity  
- Defined motion patterns for sliders and hover interactions  

### 3️⃣ Development
- Built the layout using HTML/CSS  
- Developed UI components with JavaScript/jQuery  
- Created custom dropdown menu with accessibility features (mouse hover + keyboard navigation)

- Integrated Slick Slider and built custom controls:
  Custom control bar with prev/next navigation, play/pause toggle, real-time slide index

- 2-row 4-column grid slider layout for product showcase

- Implemented responsive design with custom breakpoints:
  - **Desktop**: 1200px and above (full layout with hover effects)
  - **Tablet**: 768px - 1199px (adjusted layouts, simplified interactions)

  - **Mobile**: 767px and below (touch-optimized, dynamic slider activation)
  - <img width="522" height="850" alt="mobile view" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4a2e3fb-9045-4c30-b8ec-b7ac55e00c24" />

- Conducted cross‑browser testing and refinements

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions
- Used motion to guide user attention  
- Applied consistent animation timing for smoother flow  
- Built components to be modular and reusable  
- Prioritized clarity and simplicity in layout structure  
- Implemented mobile-first responsive approach with progressive enhancement
- Disabled hover effects on tablet/mobile for better touch experience

---

## 📚 Learnings
- Improved understanding of animation timing and easing  
- Learned how motion affects user perception and flow  
- Strengthened ability to build modular UI components  
- Mastered responsive design strategies with custom media queries
- Gained experience optimizing interactions for different devices
